# Introduction:
We are interested in examining the relationship between square footage of living space of a house and that house's price for houses sold in 2015 in King County, WA (mostly Seattle). Specifically, we are curious if square footage of living space is a good predictor of price for these houses.

```{r}
ggplot(housing)+geom_point(aes(x = sqft_living, y = price))
# price vs. sqft living
```
